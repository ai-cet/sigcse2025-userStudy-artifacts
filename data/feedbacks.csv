10083698,2,TA (Manual),1,3,"The problem in your code seems to be in the push() function. Let's analyze the issue:

c
Copy code
void push(int data)
{
    struct node *tempnode = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    tempnode->info = data;
    tempnode->ptr = NULL;
    
    if(top != NULL){
        top->ptr = tempnode;
        prev = top;
        top = top->ptr;
    }
    else 
        top = tempnode;
}
In the push() function, you correctly allocate memory for the new node and assign its info and ptr values. However, the issue lies in how you update the top pointer.

In your code, if top is not NULL, you set top->ptr to tempnode, which is correct. But then you update prev to top, and finally, you update top to top->ptr. This logic is flawed because after updating prev to top, you lose the reference to the previous top node. Therefore, you cannot correctly implement the pop() operation later.

To fix this issue, you need to update the top pointer without losing the reference to the previous top node. One way to achieve this is by updating top directly and maintaining prev as the previous top node.

Here's the corrected push() function:

c
Copy code
void push(int data)
{
    struct node *tempnode = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    tempnode->info = data;
    tempnode->ptr = top; // Point the new node's ptr to the current top
    
    top = tempnode; // Update top to point to the new node
}
This way, you correctly insert a new node at the top of the stack and maintain the references required for the pop() operation to work correctly."

10082676,2,TA (Manual),1,4,"Here are some points to consider:

Input Handling:
You've correctly implemented a loop to read input operations until ""exit"" is encountered. However, using gets() for input is not recommended due to potential buffer overflow issues. Instead, consider using safer input methods like fgets().

String Comparison:
In C, you cannot directly compare strings using the == operator. You need to use functions like strcmp() for string comparison. So, instead of if (str == ""top""), you should use if (strcmp(str, ""top"") == 0). Similarly, for other string comparisons.

Memory Allocation:
In your push() function, you've declared pointers to struct node but have not allocated memory for the new nodes. You need to use malloc() to allocate memory before assigning values to the new nodes.

Memory Management:
In the pop() function, you're freeing the memory of the top node correctly. However, you should also check if the stack is empty before attempting to pop.

Initialization of top:
Ensure that top is initialized to NULL at the beginning of the program to indicate an empty stack.

Function Prototypes:
Although you've provided function prototypes, it's a good practice to define them before the main() function or at least above the point where they're used.

Handling Other Operations:
You've left the else part empty. Consider handling other operations like ""push"" within this block."

10079280,2,TA (Manual),1,3,"This question is asking you to implement a stack data structure using a linked list in C programming language. The stack should support four operations: push, pop, top, and is_empty.

Here's a brief explanation of each operation:

push(int data): This operation adds an item at the top of the stack.
pop(): This operation removes an item from the top of the stack. If the stack is empty, nothing happens.
topelement(): This operation prints the topmost element of the stack if there is one. If the stack is empty, it prints 'X'.
is_empty(): This operation returns 1 if the stack is empty and 0 if it's not empty.
You need to read input from the standard input, process the operations accordingly, and print the output as specified.

For example, given the input ""push 1 top push 4 top exit"", the output should be ""1 4"", because after pushing 1 and 4 onto the stack, when the top operation is performed, it prints the topmost element of the stack.

To implement this, you need to define a struct node for the linked list node and maintain a global pointer top to keep track of the top of the stack. You must stick to the provided template and implement the required functions: push(), pop(), topelement(), and is_empty().

The input format includes operations like ""push 5"", ""pop"", ""top"", ""empty?"", and ""exit"". You need to read each operation, perform the corresponding stack operation, and print the output accordingly until the ""exit"" operation is encountered.

Ensure to handle cases where the stack is empty appropriately, such as printing 'X' when trying to access the top element of an empty stack.

Following the provided template and implementing the specified operations correctly will allow you to achieve the desired functionality and obtain the maximum score according to the grading scheme."
